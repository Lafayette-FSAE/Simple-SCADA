## Project Name: SCADA FSAE 2021                                 
## Module Name: can_driver.py                                                 
## Description: CAN driver contains read and write methods for interfacing with sensors on the
##  vehicle using the CANopen protocol. Unlike the other drivers in SCADA, the CAN Driver is
##  written as an object because I thought it would be easier to keep track of variables that way.
